A text adventure engine written in C by Easter <ethinethin@gmail.com>

Use the git command line tool to download, and make to compile:

% git clone https://github.com/ethinethin/Secret
% cd Secret
% make
% ./Secret

Windows:

Install Cygwin with git, gcc, and make, then follow the above instructions. The
binary will be called Secret.exe.

ABOUT THE ENGINE

This is a text adventure game engine, and comes with a finished game that is
immediately playable. Features in the game (all viewable on the help screen)
include:

	walk		navigate around the world
	look		examine surroundings or item
	search		find hidden items
	take		pick up item
	drop		drop item
	use		use item or items

In the game are 33 rooms, 22 items, and 45 interactions. I recommend playing it
before modifying the code.

================================================================================

MODIFYING

I encourage you to fork and modify the game engine with no restrictions besides
BSD 3-clause licensing terms (see LICENSE file). Below is a key to the files
used for different functions. Most .c files are paired with a .h file with the
same name for function prototypes.

	main.c 		Splash screen, enter input loop
	input.c 	Input loop, command parsing, tab completion, endings
	rooms.c 	Navigation of rooms
	rooms-desc.h 	Room descriptions
	items.c 	Take, drop, inventory, and other item functions
	items-desc.h 	Item descriptions
	inter.c 	Interaction (use) parsing and functions
	inter-even.h 	Interaction events 

If you want to write your own game without modifying the engine, the main files
you should edit are main.c (splash screen), input.c (endings), rooms-desc.h,
items-desc.h, and inter-even.h. The structs are fairly self-explanatory, but I
recommend playing through the game as is to better understand the events.

You are also free to modify any code to add or remove features.

ABOUT ME

This was an educational project for myself to learn how to write a program from
scratch in C. I thought there is a proud tradition of old-fashioned text games
written in C, so why not try to write one myself? This is also my second attempt
at this project, and I corrected a lot of the mistakes I made in the old
version.
